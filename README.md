## Welcome to the Official Site of Danmaku Python Shooter!

Danmaku Python Shooter is a shooting game where you must protect your Windows desktop from being invaded by malicious viruses.

### Story

Computer viruses have invaded your Windows desktop! As an anti-virus, it is your job to prevent these nasty bugs from corrupting the system by eliminating them one by one. Be careful, though, as a powerful enemy awaits you at the end. Can you save the precious files in your file system?

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### How to Play

Using the arrow keys to move around, and SPACEBAR to shoot, eliminate the enemies in each level without losing your health (green bar on taskbar). Some enemies will have more than 1 HP, so it is important to act fast and efficiently. Use items that fall from the sky to enable faster shooting, increased speed, and health boosters.

The starting score is 5000. For every point of health lost,
the player's score goes down by 100. Every time an enemy is
hit, you are awarded 50 points.

### Keys

ARROW KEYS = move up/down/left/right
p = pause game
r = restart game
SPACEBAR = resume/proceed (when prompted)
SPACEBAR = shoot
ESC = emergency shutdown key (closes game)
